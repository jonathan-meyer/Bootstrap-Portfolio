              Hello my name is Jonathan and I am a nerd. I like to write in almost any language but English; languages such as JavaScript, Java and C/C++ are
              some of my favorite. You can see some of my work by paroozing my GitHub
              <a href="https://github.com/jonathan-meyer" class="text-body">repository</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of my other hobbies is electronics. At the age of 12 I built an digital analog clock out of TTL integrated circuits and tons of wire. I built
              it with instructions I found in a book at the library. My father helped me buy the parts and troubleshoot the bugs as I assembled it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also enjoy doing things out side. During the winter months I snowboard down the ice slopes of New England; in the summer I can be found hiking
              many of the trails in the White Mountains. On occasion I run road races; 10k is about the longest I dare to go.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am also a fan of SyFy in all its forms: TV, moves, books and games. Both Star Wars and Star Trek are great but my favorite is Stargate; of the
              three I do believe that being able to generate a stable wormhole to a distant part of the universe is the most plausible.
